# Heart Disease Prediction Model

## Objective

This project develops a machine learning model to predict heart disease in patients using various health indicators[1]. The model employs a neural network implemented with TensorFlow and Keras to classify patients into two categories: presence or absence of heart disease[1].

## Dataset Description

The Heart Disease UCI dataset is used, containing 303 instances with 14 attributes[1]:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
- Thal (Normal, Fixed Defect, Reversible Defect)
- Target (Presence of Heart Disease)

## Steps to Run the Code in Jupyter

1. Ensure Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab is installed
2. Clone this repository to your local machine
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
5. Open the `Assignment2_HeartDisease.ipynb` file
6. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially

## Dependencies and Installation Instructions

Required Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

Install dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

Or use the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The notebook is structured as follows[1]:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Splitting (Train/Test)
4. Model Building (Neural Network)
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Predictions and Results Analysis

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 90.92% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease based on the given health indicators[1].

## Future Work

- Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters
- Incorporate feature engineering techniques
- Explore other machine learning algorithms for comparison
- Collect more data to improve model performance
